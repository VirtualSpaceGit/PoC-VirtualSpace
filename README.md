## A Proof of Concept (PoC) for VirtualSpace

Welcome to the PoC for VirtualSpace, a dynamic file monitoring and restoration system. üìÇ‚ú®

---

## Overview

VirtualSpace is designed to ensure the integrity and availability of your important data. This Proof of Concept (PoC) serves as a demonstration of our main product (in very simple terms), VirtualSpace, highlighting our ability to monitor, dynamically update, and restore files.

## Features

- **File Monitoring**: Continuously monitors a specified file for changes and deletions.
- **Dynamic Content Update**: Automatically updates the stored content when the file is modified.
- **File Restoration**: Restores the file with the most recent content if it is deleted.

## How It Works

The core functionality is encapsulated in the `FileMonitor` class, which performs the following tasks:
1. **Initial Setup**: Checks if the target file exists and reads its content.
2. **Monitoring Loop**: Continuously monitors the file:
   - If the file is deleted, it restores it with the last known content.
   - If the file is modified, it updates the stored content to reflect the changes.

## Playing Around with It üß™

Feel free to edit `virtualspace.txt` with any content you like. The program will:
- Detect changes and update its internal record.
- Restore the file with the latest content if it's deleted.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Alert**: For educational purposes, please ensure that `virtualspace.txt` is in the same directory as the executable when running the program. This requirement is to simplify the file access logic and demonstrate the core functionality of the VirtualSpace system effectively. In a production environment, the system would be designed to handle files in different directories and include more robust error handling and configuration options.
